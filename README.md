# marcusaandahl-nvim
## TODO
- [ ] Markdown/pdf support?
- [ ] Git undo selected changes support
- [ ] Git merge/rebase/cherry-pick support
- [ ] Improve window management mappings (creation/movement/sizing)

Files auto-save using auto commands (see `autocmds.lua`).

## Configuration structure
In the root, there is an `init.lua` file.
In it, you can require the profile you want to use.
These profiles are in the `lua` directory.
Currently, the default, main and only one is `marcusaandahl`.

In the `lua/marcusaandahl` directory is the main configuration profile.
The entry file is `init.lua`, which maps the leader key `Space`, and requires other files, which in all make up the configuration.

### lazy_init.lua
This file sets up the package manager `lazy`. It defines the `/lazy` directory as the one containing the plugins.

### set.lua
This file defines standard vim configurations, such as tab spaces, text warp, and more notibly, the `treesitter` plugin configuration (see the plugins section).

### keys.lua
This file sets the primary keymappings, along with any setup which might need changing in the future.

### autocmds.lua
This file sets auto-commands. The most notable auto-command is the one which automatically saves files.

### colors.lua
This file sets the colorscheme.

### after.lua
This file sets up the LSP configuration and linting.

## Plugins
### overseer.nvim
Used for run configuration management.
Run configurations are per-project, which are stored in the project's `.nvim/run_configs.json` file.

### autopair.nvim
Autopairs brackets. So if one types `(`, and equivalent `)` will be inserted.

### conform.nvim
Code formatter. Use keymap `=` in visual mode to format the selection.
Its configuration is in the `after.lua` directory.

### neo-tree.nvim
Enables visualisation of file tree. Usefuly for when an overview of the project is needed.
It also includes other minor plugins, mainly for libraries and icons.

### nvim-cmp
Enables autocompletion. See the files in the `/cmp` directory to see the configuration.

I am slightly unsure how it is configured, but i think that it requires 2 steps to add autocompletion for a language:
1. Adding it to the `lazy/nvim-cmp.lua` files under `Completion Sources`.
2. Adding it to the `cmp/sources.lua` file.

### nvim.dap
Used for enabling debugging.

### project.nvim
Used for project management.
It is set to manual mode, to explicitely add/remove projects.

### telescope.nvim
Used for file/word/project search.
Run configuration mapping can be edited in there.

### todo-comments.nvim
Used for highlighting comments with certain keywords such as `TODO` or `INFO`.

### tokyonight.nvim
Used colorscheme.

### nvim-treesitter
Provides text highlighting. In the `set.lua` file, the path to the treesitter configuration is defined (by default the `treesitter-config.lua` file).

In the `treesitter-config.lua` file, languages can be added for syntax highlighting.

### undotree
Provides undotree for managing undos in a git-style.
It can be in other words be described as a local version control for the edits you are making.

### which-key.nvim
Provides grouping for keymappings. Useful for when learning commands.

### mason.nvim
### mason-lspconfig.nvim

### VIM native
* `.` runs last motion
* `Ctrl-V` visualises in block mode.
This can be combined with `j`|`k` up and down motions to select multiple lines, and press `I` to insert at multiple lines.
Once finished, press `Escape` to manifest the changes.
* `Ctrl-W J` moves window to left side.
* `Ctrl-W L` moves window to right side.
* `Ctrl-W K` moves window to upper side.
* `Ctrl-W J` moves window to down side.
* `Ctrl-W j` move to window on the left side.
* `Ctrl-W l` move to window on the right side.
* `Ctrl-W k` move to window on the upper side.
* `Ctrl-W j` move to window on the down side.
* `Ctrl-w v` creates a vertical window
* `Ctrlw- q` quits window

This file will have things added to it as more useful motions are discovered.
